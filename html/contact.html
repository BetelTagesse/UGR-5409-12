            <h1>Contact</h1>
            <p>Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and countless other social media platforms play a huge role in the growth of businesses. In this day and age where technology is vital, don’t let your business fall behind because of its lack of participation in social media.

                Social media is easy, fun to use and it can humanize your company, but the best part about it is that it is completely free. As a technology company, we at FirstABS recognize that “free,” “easy,” and most importantly, “effective” are not three things commonly found together, so we encourage you to take advantage of this communication platform.</p>
