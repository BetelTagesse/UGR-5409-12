        <h4>future</h4>
        <p>Everybody has an aim at least, and also lays down the plans for their future.
            In fact, a man must have an aim. If a man doesn’t have an
            aim, he looks like a foreigner without a travel guide. The places he
            wants to go to can’t be arrived in
            short time. Even if he luckily arrives,
            he doesn’t know that the place is where he wants. He also takes a long
            time and sometimes troubles.</p>
