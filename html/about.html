            <p>I am Betel Tagesse who is a 20years old  3<sup>rd</sup> year software engineering student at Addis Ababa institute of technology. I have always dreamt of becoming a tech student so that i can develop a different softwares. 
            Though i did not take ICT subject in our school properly, i used to study programming languages in summer time. Since i am now studying in Addis Ababa university, i have a great opportunity to explore different things.
            i have teamed up with great students to do projects where i believe i got so much experience and friends. I also  help young students who have passion about software related topics in summer time.

                <h2>My school life</h2>
                <p>During my time at vision School I have been given the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities. Having the
                    chance to be a part programming teams has benefited me and impacted my life in many ways. I believe that having the
                    opportunity to compete in highschool programming activities is extremely important and beneficial to students. A student  can learn so many
                    valuable lessons from those around them. Throughout high school, I have learned to work with different personalities in
                    teammates. I have found that not one teammate is the same.
                     The ability to adjust to different people in a competitive environment will be valuable in my future of school,
